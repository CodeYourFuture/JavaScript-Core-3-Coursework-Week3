## Question 1

Take a look at the following code:

```
1    let x = 1;
2    function f1()
3    {
4        let x = 2;
5        console.log(x);
6    }
7    console.log(x);
```

Explain why line 4 and line 6 output different numbers.
- Because in line 4 the "X" belongs to a variable that have an output of "2"
- Because "X" is defined as a global scoped and makes an output of "1"

## Question 2

Take a look at the following code:

```
let x = 10

function f1()
{
    console.log(x)
    let y = 20
}

console.log(f1())
console.log(y)
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.
- "X" is a global variable after F1 is being consoled answer is "10"
- "Y" is defined inside the function, if is defined outside the function will appear: NOT DEFINED

=> 10
Undefined

## Question 3

Take a look at the following code:

```
const x = 9;

function f1(val) {
  val = val + 1;
  return val;
}

f1(x);
console.log(x);

const y = { x: 9 };

function f2(val) {
  val.x = val.x + 1;
  return val;
}

f2(y);
console.log(y);
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.

- Constant can not be changed "10" will remain "9".
- Objects properties can be change on line 62.
=> 9
{x:10}
