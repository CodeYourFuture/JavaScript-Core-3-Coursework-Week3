# Code reading

## Question 1

Take a look at the following code:

```
1    let x = 1;
2    function f1()
3    {
4        let x = 2;
5        console.log(x);
6    }
7    console.log(x);
```

Explain why line 4 and line 6 output different numbers.

line 5s console log gives x the value inside the functions scope but not outside.
line 7s console log is logging the value of x in the global scope.

## Question 2

Take a look at the following code:

```
let x = 10

function f1()
{
    console.log(x)
    let y = 20
}

console.log(f1())
console.log(y)
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.

should print 10 out at first as x has a value of 10 in the global scope but x's value is defined outside the function. it will throw an error for the second console log as the command cannot access it inside the function.

## Question 3

Take a look at the following code:

```
const x = 9;

function f1(val) {
  val = val + 1;
  return val;
}

f1(x);
console.log(x);

const y = { x: 9 };

function f2(val) {
  val.x = val.x + 1;
  return val;
}

f2(y);
console.log(y);
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.
f1 will return 9 still as it is defined with a const so cannot be changed.
f2 objects properties can be modified.
