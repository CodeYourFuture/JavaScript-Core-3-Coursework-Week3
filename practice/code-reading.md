# Code reading

## Question 1

Take a look at the following code:

```
1    let x = 1;
2    function f1() 
3    {
4        let x = 2;
5        console.log(x);
6    }
7    console.log(x);
```

Explain why line 4 and line 6 output different numbers.
x has already been called as a global variable outside the function


## Question 2

Take a look at the following code:

```
let x = 10

function f1()
{
    console.log(x)
    let y = 20
}

console.log(f1())
console.log(y)

```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.
x will be logged as 10,because it is a global variable.
console.log(f1()) will output undefined
console.log(y) will output reference error because why is inside the f1 function.

## Question 3

Take a look at the following code:

```
const x = 9;

function f1(val) {
  val = val + 1;
  return val;
}

f1(x);
console.log(x);

const y = { x: 9 };

function f2(val) {
  val.x = val.x + 1;
  return val;
}

f2(y);
console.log(y);
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.
f1 will return 9 because x is a constant variable
f2 will return 10,because object property can be modified
